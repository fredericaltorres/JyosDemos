\n\nThen methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer \nSwung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor. \n"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he hath sent thee \nRespite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore! \nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!" \n                Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." \n\n"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! - \nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, \nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted- \nOn this home by Horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore- \nIs there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!" \n                Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." \n\n"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! \nBy that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore- \nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, \nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore- \nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore." \n                Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." \n\n"Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend," I shrieked, upstarting- \n"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night\'s Plutonian shore! \nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! \nLeave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door! \nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!" \n                Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." \n\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting \nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; \nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon\'s that is dreaming, \nAnd the lamp-light o\'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; \nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor \n                Shall be lifted- nevermore!
